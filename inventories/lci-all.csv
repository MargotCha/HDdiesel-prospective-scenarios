comment,"Wet poplar (50%) was selected as the feedstock of the gasification process due to the increasing interest in the production of second-generation biofuels from short-rotation plantation, which can be grown with little input and in relatively small areas. 
Low pressure indirect gasification and tar reforming, consisting of two fluidized bed reactor. 
Carbon capture is performed via PSA and membrane separation.
